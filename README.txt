The setup of our sample database is similar to the setup of the databases used in homework. The relevant files are 'setup.sh' and 'create.sql'.
Copy these files into the same directory in the course VM and run 'setup.sh' (it may be necessary to change the permissions on this file to make it executable),
then enter 'psql conversations' to run sample queries.
