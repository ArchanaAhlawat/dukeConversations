# dukeConversations

Duke Conversations is a program at Duke that holds dinners several times a week as a way to promote conversation and connection between students and faculty. 

This project has the goal of streamlining the application process for the dinners, getting a step closer to automating acceptances in a way that is fair to all, and provide data on who is being reached.
